# clics-data
This is a data-directory for CLICS where we store and edit and exchange new data and ideas to be produced in the future.

# Overview on Interesting New Datasets

* wordnet: original tests on automatic mapping have been made, added an extract from the main-data to conceptlists/ folder (far too many words and definitions, yet we may need them for exact mapping)
* simlex: data in good shape and can be used both for network creation and comparison, added tsv-version to conceptlists/ folder
* ufc: offers a network-tsv-file which has been added as conceptlists/UFC.tsv
